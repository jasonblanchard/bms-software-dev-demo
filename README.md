# web-dev-demo
This is a small web app to demonstrate Web and mobile software development. There are 3 parts:

- A *server-side API* that accepts HTTP requests. This usually runs on a "server" in a remote data center, but you can run it locally on your computer for development. All the code for the APi server is in the `server/` directory (a "directory" is just a folder on your computer).
- A browser-based *web client app*. This is the application that you see in your browser. All the code for the web client are in the `/client` directory.
- A *bot* that is programmed to act like a user interacting with the app. It randomly posts lines from the movie Back To The Future, but can be modified to post about anything. All the code for the bot is in the `bot/` directory.

All three parts are written in a programming language called [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).
